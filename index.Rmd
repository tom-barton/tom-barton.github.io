I'm a Post-Doctoral Researcher in Politics at King's College London on the [Advocacy in Digital Democracy: Use, Impact & Democratic consequences project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/864648) I hold a PhD from Royal Holloway, University of London. My PhD focused on the impact of Voter Identification (ID) laws on election turnout and perceptions of democratic integrity.

I created the Comparative Voter ID Law dataset (CVIL) which details the voter ID law in each country along with other key characteristics.

More generally I am interested in elections, public opinion (particularly social values) and quantitative research methods.
