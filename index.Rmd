I'm Tom Barton a PhD Candidate at Royal Holloway, University of London. I hold a BA (Hons) in Politics and International Relations with Quantitative Research from the University of Kent and a MSc in Elections, Campaigns and Democracy from Royal Holloway. My PhD focuses on the impact of Voter Identification laws on election turnout and perceptions of democratic integrity.

I created the Comparative Voter ID Law dataset (CVIL) which details the voter ID law in each country along with other key characteristics.

More generally I am interested in elections, public opinion (particularly social values) and quantitative research methods.
